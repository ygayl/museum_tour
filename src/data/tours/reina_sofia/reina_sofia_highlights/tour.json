  "introNarration": "Welcome to the Museo Reina Sofía, Spain’s home for modern and contemporary art. You’re in a place where artistic revolution meets political awakening, where bold ideas left the studio and entered public life—and forever changed how a country sees itself.\n\nThis collection was born with Spain’s new democracy. A former hospital became a promise: modern art deserves a national stage. Temporary shows grew into a permanent home, officially opened in 1992 and named for Queen Sofía, to safeguard the avant‑garde and its restless future.\n\nIn the next 60 minutes, we’ll follow a living conversation between creativity, power, and feeling. You’ll sense rupture and reinvention—cubist breaks, surreal openings, and contemporary echoes of war, memory, and hope. We’ll look closely, listen for courage and tenderness, and let these works reshape how we see.\n\nFrom the Sabatini Building’s main entrance, pass security and head to the glass elevators. Ride to Level 2. Follow signs for Collection 1, Room 201, then 201.02. Our first stop is Picasso’s Mujer en azul—poised, enigmatic, electric with possibility. Ready? Let’s begin.",

  "outroNarration": "We've just walked through some of the most defining moments in Spanish modern art—from Picasso's early experiments to the raw power of Guernica, with some brilliant detours through Surrealism and the undersung voices like Ángeles Santos along the way. Not a bad hour's work.\n\nThanks for spending this time with us. If you're curious to see where some of these artists drew their inspiration, the Prado is just down the road—Museum Made Easy has a tour there too that traces the Spanish masters who shaped what Picasso and his generation were reacting against. Worth the visit while you're in Madrid.\n\nThe Reina Sofía has plenty more to discover beyond what we've covered today, so feel free to wander. And if you're looking for more tours here or elsewhere, Museum Made Easy has you sorted. Enjoy the rest of your time in Madrid—this city has a way of keeping you curious.",

      "narration": "Our journey through Spanish modernism begins here, with one of Picasso's most haunting explorations of color and solitude.\n\nBlue settles over this canvas like dusk over still water. Not the blue of open sky, but something denser, more interior. A blue that holds its breath. The woman before you exists within this chromatic solitude, her form emerging from shadows that might be the room around her, or might be the weight of her own thoughts made visible.\n\nNotice how Picasso renders her presence. Whether through angular planes or softer contours, she is both there and not there, solid and dissolving. The blue does more than color her world. It becomes atmosphere, becomes temperature, becomes the very air she breathes. This is what paint can do in certain hands—it stops being decoration and becomes emotional weather.\n\nPerhaps this woman sits in that quiet hour when afternoon tips toward evening, when we're most alone with ourselves. Perhaps she represents one of the countless women who passed through Picasso's vision, transformed by his relentless need to see beneath surfaces, to find the architecture of feeling. We cannot know her name, her story, what she was thinking if she posed for this, or if she lived only in the artist's imagination.\n\nWhat remains is this blue, this solitude made palpable. Stand with her a moment longer. Let the color work on you the way cold works on skin, the way certain kinds of loneliness sharpen rather than blur our sense of being alive. The painting asks nothing but your presence, offers nothing but its own quiet insistence on being seen.",

      "floor": 2,
      "narration": "Picture this: a teenager, barely eighteen years old, paints a room full of towering, mysterious figures that look like they've stepped out of a fever dream. That's Ángeles Santos in 1929, creating works like Tertulia (The Gathering) when most of us are still figuring out what to do with our lives. She wasn't just talented for her age. She was shaking up the entire Spanish art world.\n\nLook at these figures gathered around the table. They're elongated, almost architectural, with those blank, mask-like faces. It's a gathering, sure, but something feels off. The bodies seem to float and stretch in impossible ways. Santos was tapping into surrealism, but with her own eerily elegant twist. These aren't the melting clocks or ants-on-hands you might expect. This is more subtle, more haunting.\n\nWhat makes this even more remarkable is the context. In 1929, Santos had her first solo exhibition in Barcelona. Critics were stunned. Here was this young woman creating bold, avant-garde work that held its own alongside the era's most experimental artists. She was part of a brief, brilliant moment in Spanish modern art, right before everything changed.\n\nAnd here's the heartbreaking part: In the years around the Spanish Civil War, amid personal struggles and upheaval, Santos largely moved away from this surrealist style. Those circumstances shifted her work dramatically. She lived until 2013, but these early paintings, including Tertulia, remain her most celebrated. They capture a young artist at the height of her powers, creating dreamscapes that still unsettle us nearly a century later. That teenage vision? Turns out it was timeless.",

      "floor": 2,
      "narration": "Okay, so imagine you're trying to explain what a bottle looks like to someone over the phone. You'd describe the label from the front, the curve from the side, maybe how it looks from above, right? That's basically what Juan Gris is doing here, except he's showing you all those views at once, laid out like pieces of a puzzle on the canvas.\n\nGris was the organized, methodical one in the Cubist crew. While Picasso was breaking things apart with wild energy, Gris was more like an architect, carefully building images back up using geometric shapes and bright, clear colors. He often described his approach as flat, colored architecture, and you can really see that here. Notice how everything feels structured, almost decorative, with those clean planes of color.\n\nThat bottle he's painted? It's often read as Anís del Mono, a Spanish liqueur that was everywhere in the cafés of early 1900s Paris. For Gris and other Spanish artists living in Paris, it was a little taste of home. But it's also just the perfect subject for Cubism because everyday objects like bottles, newspapers, and glasses have recognizable features. You can fragment them, rearrange them, show the front and back simultaneously, and we still know exactly what we're looking at.\n\nWhat's clever is that Gris isn't trying to confuse you. He's actually giving you more information than a traditional painting would. You're seeing this bottle from multiple angles in a single moment, like your brain is assembling everything it knows about this object all at once.\n\nThis approach, called Synthetic Cubism, ended up influencing everything from advertising to graphic design. We're still using this idea today, showing multiple perspectives to tell a fuller story.",

      "order": 4,
      "room": "204.01",
      "floor": 2,
      "narration": "Imagine trying to paint a game of cards, but instead of capturing one frozen moment, you want to show every angle at once, like flipping through all the cards in the deck simultaneously. That's exactly the puzzle Braque's working on here.\n\nLook at how nothing sits still in this painting. Those playing cards aren't just scattered, they're shattered into geometric pieces. You can spot fragments of suits, maybe a diamond here, an edge of a card there. The dice feel both flat and dimensional at the same time, which is kind of the whole point. Braque and his partner-in-crime Picasso were obsessed with this idea in the early nineteen hundreds: why should a painting only show you what one eye sees from one spot? They wanted to give you the experience of walking around an object, picking it up, turning it over, all compressed into a single image.\n\nCards and dice weren't random choices. These were the props of Parisian café life, the world Braque actually inhabited. But here's what makes it brilliant: games of chance are about uncertainty, about multiple possible outcomes, and that's exactly what Cubism does to reality. It refuses to give you one solid answer about what you're looking at.\n\nNotice how flat everything feels, almost like cut paper layered on top of each other? Braque developed techniques that blurred the line between painting and collage, between illusion and actual texture. He's not asking you to believe you're looking at real cards on a real table. He's inviting you into a new way of seeing where multiple truths can exist in the same space. In our world of split screens and multiple browser tabs, maybe Braque was just ahead of his time.",

      "order": 5,
      "room": "205.06",
      "floor": 2,
      "narration": "In 1929, an eighteen-year-old girl shocked the Madrid art world with this painting. Ángeles Santos was barely out of school when she created this monumental surrealist vision—and nothing in Spanish art looked quite like it.\n\nTake in the scale first. This is a world unto itself: towering architecture, strange mannequin figures, a dreamlike city stretching across nearly ten feet of canvas. Notice how Santos builds her landscape in layers—classical colonnades beside modern buildings, vast plazas opening onto impossible perspectives. The palette is muted, almost ghostly: grays, pale ochres, washed-out blues. It feels both ancient and eerily futuristic.\n\nLook closely at the figures. They're not quite human—smooth, featureless forms frozen mid-gesture. Some scholars see echoes of Giorgio de Chirico's metaphysical paintings here, that same sense of mysterious emptiness in grand architectural spaces. But Santos makes it entirely her own. This isn't Italy's sun-drenched piazzas—it's something more cerebral, more introspective.\n\nHere's what makes this astonishing: Santos painted Un mundo before Spanish Surrealism truly took hold, working largely in isolation in Valladolid. When it debuted at Madrid's Salón de Otoño in 1929, critics couldn't believe someone so young—and a woman, in conservative 1920s Spain—had produced something so ambitious and psychologically complex.\n\nThe painting captures that threshold moment between adolescence and adulthood, between dream and waking life. Santos called it \"a world,\" not \"the world.\" Her world. A private universe of symbols and spaces that she dared to make monumentally, unapologetically public. At eighteen, she wasn't waiting for permission to create her masterpiece. She simply did.",

      "order": 6,
      "room": "205.11",
      "floor": 2,
      "narration": "In this portrait of a woman with her fan, notice how María Blanchard refuses to let either rest in comfortable certainty. The figure fragments, reassembles, insists on being seen through multiple moments at once. Planes of color shift and overlap, as if Blanchard is asking: which angle reveals the truth of a person? Which perspective captures what it means to hold something delicate in a world of sharp edges?\n\nThe fan, that traditional accessory of feminine performance, becomes geometry and possibility. Perhaps Blanchard, working in Paris during the 1910s and 20s among the cubist masters, understood something about being looked at, about being reduced to surface and angle. She knew what it meant to exist in a body the world found difficult, having lived her entire life with severe physical disabilities that shaped how others saw her, how she moved through spaces designed for other forms.\n\nIn this fragmented work, one might sense a different kind of seeing, a refusal of the single, fixing gaze. The woman with her fan exists in multiplicity, not pinned down, not fully known. Blanchard learned cubism from the men who claimed to have invented new ways of seeing, then she turned those fractured planes toward her own questions about presence, about being perceived.\n\nThe painting holds its secrets close, reveals and conceals in the same gesture, much like the fan itself, that ancient tool of disclosure and mystery. What remains is this: a woman, reimagined not as object of sight but as a shifting constellation of moments, angles, possibilities. Blanchard offers no single truth, only the dignity of complexity.",

      "room": "205.13",
      "floor": 2,
      "narration": "Here's a painting with one of the most provocative titles in modern art, and Dalí chose it deliberately. The Great Masturbator, from 1929, marks the moment when a young Spanish artist fully embraced Surrealism and his own deepest anxieties.\n\nLook at that massive distorted face in profile, eyes closed, almost melting into the rocks. It dominates the canvas. Near the center, you'll see a grasshopper with ants crawling on its abdomen. Dalí wrote in his autobiography about his terror of grasshoppers since childhood. Below the face, a female figure appears, and across the composition are geological forms from the cliffs of Cadaqués, where Dalí painted this.\n\nHe created this work during the summer of 1929, the same season he met Gala Éluard, who would become his lifelong partner and muse. That meeting, in that place, transformed his work. The painting pulls together currents in Surrealist circles at the time: the Surrealists’ interests in Freudian psychoanalysis and dream imagery. Dalí was twenty-five and creating his own visual language of desire and fear.\n\nThe technique shows his academic training at work. Despite the bizarre imagery, the rendering is precise. Those rocky forms come directly from the Costa Brava coastline he knew intimately.\n\nThis painting announces an artist willing to expose psychological territory most people keep hidden. The title isn't meant to shock for shock's sake. It's Dalí claiming his anxieties and obsessions as legitimate subjects for serious art.",

      "order": 8,
      "room": "205.14",
      "floor": 2,
      "narration": "Here, against darkness, three presences hold the night. A woman rises, her form distilled to gesture and curve. A dog, small and watchful, anchors the earth below. And the moon, that ancient witness, hangs luminous in the void between them.\n\nMiró painted with the vocabulary of dreams and signs. By the time he created this work, he had long since abandoned the literal world for something more essential. What remains are symbols worn smooth as river stones, shapes that carry meaning without explaining it. The woman is not a portrait but an idea of presence. The dog is not a pet but a companion through mystery. The moon does not illuminate so much as it exists, patient and eternal.\n\nLook at how little is here, and how much. A few forms floating in space, yet they create an entire cosmology. This is the landscape of the interior, where a dog can be as significant as a celestial body, where a human figure dissolves into pure silhouette yet loses none of its dignity. Miró, who grew up under the vast skies of Catalonia, who watched the Mediterranean light transform simple things into wonders, learned to paint what remains when everything unnecessary falls away.\n\nThere is loneliness here, perhaps, but not isolation. These three exist together in their separate spheres, connected by nothing visible yet bound by the artist's hand, by his insistence that a woman, a dog, and the moon can share a canvas and call it universe enough. Stand here long enough and you might feel it too, that quiet companionship of things that exist beside each other in the dark, asking nothing, offering presence.",

      "floor": 2,
      "narration": "This is one of the most powerful anti-war statements ever painted. This massive canvas, over twenty-five feet wide, stopped the world in its tracks in 1937. It still does today.\n\nLook at the chaos Picasso created here. A horse screams in the center, its body pierced. A bull stands to the left. Bodies fragment across the canvas. A woman wails, holding her dead child. Another figure burns, arms raised. See that stark lightbulb at the top, glaring like an evil eye. Everything rendered in blacks, whites, and grays. No color. No mercy.\n\nOn April twenty-sixth, 1937, German and Italian warplanes bombed the Basque town of Guernica during the Spanish Civil War. It was market day. The attack lasted over three hours. Picasso, living in Paris, read the news and began this painting within days. The Spanish Republic had commissioned him for a mural for their pavilion at the Paris World's Fair. He'd been stuck, unsure what to paint. The bombing gave him his answer. He finished it in just over a month, working in his studio on Rue des Grands Augustins. Photographs document his process, showing how the composition evolved.\n\nPicasso chose the visual language of his Cubist experiments but weaponized it for this moment. The fractured forms aren't just style. They mirror the violence itself. Bodies break apart like the technique breaks apart space.\n\nAfter the fair, this painting traveled the world raising funds for Spanish war relief. Picasso declared it shouldn't return to Spain until democracy was restored. It spent decades at New York's Museum of Modern Art. Only after Franco's death did it finally come home, in 1981.\n\nYou're not just seeing a masterpiece. You're standing before a painting that changed what art could do, proving that images could bear witness as powerfully as any words. And with that, we conclude our journey through Spanish art's most transformative moments.",
